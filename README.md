![alt text](https://github.com/se7en9057/ErgoDOX-2.0/blob/master/ErgoDox2.0.png) 
An update to a classic. <br />
-more switch compatibility<br />
  -MX Alps PG1350<br />
-in switch LED's<br />
-underglow RGB<br />
-Pro Micro each side for individual hand operation<br />
-same PCB layout to ensure compatibility with existing cases. <br />
  -after some consideration in order to bring this board to a more current state using the two controller method i will be adding a second controller to the flip board. meaning there will be some case incompatibility. long term would have an onboard controller which would negate this issue. so R0v1 will not be compatible with existing standard cases with out modification or standoffs.<br />
